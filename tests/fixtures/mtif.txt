DST is retarded..............<br/><br/>It ruins my early morning wakeup, and it makes me go around changing all my clocks to match this stupid time change. UGH!!!!!!!<br/>

Right.<br/><br/>Now, try writing software that's intended to work all over the world where each country has slightly different rules for when DST is supposed to hit and where you can't necessarily trust the user to have set up the time zone on their machine properly.&#xA0; And, as we found out recently, it's not a physical law, so governments feel like tinkering with it.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I knew that governments have a habit of changing DST, so I coded for that case.&#xA0; Not everybody else does.&#xA0; <br/>
